<p>Hi, I'm Chi 👋</p>
<p>I’m a data scientist, applied AI researcher (Ph.D.), and writer from a coastal city in Vietnam, surrounded by fresh seafood and the scent of the sea.</p>
<p>🔭 I’m currently focused on building AI Agent solutions that create meaningful value for clients.</p>
<p>📝 I enjoy writing and teaching, sharing my ideas and knowledge through words and speech.</p>
<p>💖 Previously, I spent 7 years teaching at a university and 5 years researching applied AI in telecommunications.</p>
<p>🎓 I originally planned a career in wireless communications, but discovering AI sparked my curiosity and shaped the path I’m on today.</p>
<p>I'm best reached via LinkedIn. I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.</p>
