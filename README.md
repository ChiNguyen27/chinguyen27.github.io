Hi, I'm Chi 👋

I’m a Data Scientist dedicated to building intelligent AI agents that drives solutions across sectors including tax, finance and energy sectors. I hold a Ph.D. in applied AI, and have a strong passionate about writing about technology and daily life story. 

I'm a coastal city in Vietnam, only an 1.5 hour  from stunning to Halong Bay. Life in my hometown is surrounded by aroma of seafood and the gentle breeze of the sea.

🔭 I’m currently focused on building AI Agent solutions that create meaningful value for clients.

📝 I enjoy writing and teaching, sharing my ideas and knowledge through words and speech.

💖 Previously, I spent 7 years teaching at a university and 5 years researching applied AI in 5G/6G networks.

🎓 I originally planned a career in wireless communications, but discovering AI sparked my curiosity and shaped the path I’m on today.

I'm best reached via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chi-nguyen-a612421b2/). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
