Hi, I'm Chi 👋

I’m a data scientist, applied AI researcher (Ph.D.), and writer from a coastal city in Vietnam, surrounded by fresh seafood and the scent of the sea.

🔭 I’m currently focused on building AI Agent solutions that create meaningful value for clients.

📝 I enjoy writing and teaching, sharing my ideas and knowledge through words and speech.

💖 Previously, I spent 7 years teaching at a university and 5 years researching applied AI in telecommunications.

🎓 I originally planned a career in wireless communications, but discovering AI sparked my curiosity and shaped the path I’m on today.

I'm best reached via [Connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chi-nguyen-a612421b2/). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
