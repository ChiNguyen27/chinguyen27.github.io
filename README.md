Hi, I'm Chi 👋

I’m a data scientist, applied AI researcher, and writer from a coastal city in Vietnam, surrounded by fresh seafood and the scent of the sea.

🔭 I currently work on AI Agent projects.
📝 I enjoy writing and teaching, sharing my ideas and knowledge through words and speech.
💖 Previously, I spent 7 years teaching at a university and 5 years researching applied AI in telecommunications.
🎓 I originally planned a career in wireless communications, but discovering AI sparked my curiosity and shaped the path I’m on today.
